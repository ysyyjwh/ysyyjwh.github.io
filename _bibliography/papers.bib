  title={Bikeshare users on a budget? A trip chaining analysis of bikeshare user groups in Chicago},
  author={Siyue Yang, Candace Brakewood and Virgile Nicolas},
  abstract={This analysis focuses on a smartphone app known as “Transit” that is used to unlock shared bicycles in Chicago. Data from the app were utilized in a three-part analysis. First, Transit app bikeshare usage patterns were compared with system-wide bikeshare utilization using publicly available data. The results revealed that hourly usage on weekdays generally follows classical peaked commuting patterns; however, daily usage reached its highest level on weekends. This suggests that there may be large numbers of both commuting and recreational users. The second part aimed to identify distinct user groups via cluster analysis; the results revealed six different clusters: (1) commuters, (2) utility users, (3) leisure users, (4) infrequent commuters, (5) weekday visitors, and (6) weekend visitors. The group unlocking the most shared bikes (45.58% of all Transit app unlocks) was commuters, who represent 10% of Transit app bikeshare users. The third part proposed a trip chaining algorithm to identify “trip chaining bikers.” This term refers to bikeshare users who return a shared bicycle and immediately check out another, presumably to avoid paying extra usage fees for trips over 30 min. The algorithm revealed that 27.3% of Transit app bikeshare users exhibited this type of “bike chaining” behavior. However, this varied substantially between user groups; notably, 66% of Transit app bikeshare users identified as commuters made one or more bike chaining unlocks. The implications are important for bikeshare providers to understand the impact of pricing policies, particularly in encouraging the turn-over of bicycles.},

#### Drawing & Painting 
 
 I have learnt traditional Chinese painting for 3 years. During my undergraduate, I joined [Calligraphantasy](https://www.facebook.com/calligrafantasy/photos/?ref=page_internal), a Calligraphy club that offers a channel for appreciation of traditional East Chinese culture and aesthetics education.

#### Social Acitivities 

 I was the leader of [Special Hall Night Talk](https://cityu-hall2.github.io/talk/index.html) team during 2018-2019. Our team has been organized monthly talks that provides opportunities for univeristy residents to approach and learn from the renowned elites in the society. 

 
 I am also active in [IT workshops](https://cityu-hall2.github.io/it/index.html). I helped organise two [CityHack Hackathons](https://cityu-hall2.github.io/cityhack/index.html) (for the first and scond time in CityU), which emphasize â€œcoding-everybody" and ecourage students to work together and develop innovative products to adress the given problems using AI technologies.

  These very experiences are derived from my early passions of sharing, and further lead to my awareness of the value of passing down knowledge to people from different backgrounds. My sense of mission and personality gradually turn me into a deliverer of knowledge and value.

I am a 2nd year PhD student in Statistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Jessica Gronsbell](https://sites.google.com/view/jgronsbell/home) and [Prof. Lei Sun](http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/sun/). My research interests centers around developing statistical methods for electronic hospital records (EHR) data, including electronic phenotyping and the downstream genetic association analysis using EHR. 

Prior to PhD, I finished my undergraduate in the Department of Mathematics(http://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/), the City University of Hong Kong in 2019.
